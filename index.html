	<h2>Odyssey of the Mind</h2>

	<p class="spacing">I participated in odyssey of the mind for 5 years. Odyssey of the mind is a program that promotes creative problem solving. In the time I spent in this program I was able to learn so many ways of approaching and concerning a problem. This program was also a creative outlet for me, because as a team we had to create an eight minute play with props and  scenery. I learn teamwork as well as the values of each team member. Being apart of this program I was able to embrace my creativity which has made me the person I am today.
</p>
<h2>Theater</h2>
<p class="spacing">I have been acting and performing ever since I can remember.I was alway in the Christmas plays that my church would put on until middle school where I joined the theater club.I have been in two different Peter Pan plays. The first one I played the part of Wendy Darling, and the second one I was Mrs.Darling. I was also in the play The Crucible, where I was Mercy. After that I started to go to a school that didnâ€™t have a theater club so I made one with the help of some friends and became the president of it.Being a part of theater has helped me a lot with public speaking and leadership skills.</p>
